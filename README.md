OFX parser bundle
=================

##Fork'd
This is a fork of [grimfor/ofxparser](https://github.com/Grimfor/ofxparser) made to be framework independent. The source repo was designed for Symfony 2 framework, so credit should be given where credit due!

##Installation

Add in your composer.json:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "asgrim/ofxparser": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Now tell composer to download the bundle by running the command:

``` bash
$ php composer.phar update asgrim/ofxparser
